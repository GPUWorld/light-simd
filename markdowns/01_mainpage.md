# Light SIMD 

**SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)** generally refers to instruction sets to support data-parallel computation. An SIMD instruction may operate on multiple data simultaneously within one or a few cycles. 
Many numerical algorithms involve repeatedly applying the same sequence of math operations to thousands or millions of data values. In this programs, proper use of SIMD can often lead to substantial improvement of run-time performance.
